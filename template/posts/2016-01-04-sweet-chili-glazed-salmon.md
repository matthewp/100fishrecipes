I don't do well with main dishes that are too sweet so this one worried me just a little bit as I prepared the glaze. By the time I had it all together and the salmon marinating I felt much better about how it would turn out. And am I glad I stuck with it; one of the better salmon dishes I've had in a while. It's also the first time I'm broiled fish since starting the site. It came out tender but completely cooked; I'll be looking for more recipes that use this technique in the future.

All in all, highly recommended.

### Ingredients

1. 4 pieces of salmon (I had only 2, but the glaze is good for 4)

2. 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce

3. 1 1/2 tablespoons Orange Marmalade

4. 3 tablespoons soy sauce

5. 2 tablespoons green onion, minced

6. 1 clove garlic, minced

7. salt and pepper

### Steps

1. Mix the sweet chili sauce, orange marmalade and soy sauce in a shallow baking dish.

2. Add in the green onion and garlic.

3. Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper and place skin side up in the disk. Allow to marinate for an hour.

4. Preheat the boiler and prepare a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Spray with cooking spray.

5. Take the salmon out of the baking dish and shake off the excess glaze.

6. Place the salmon skin side down on the baking sheet and broil 6-10 minutes, until browned but still tender.

7. Plate and pour the extra glaze over top the filets.

8. Enjoy!
