Smoked Salmon - [Health.com](http://www.health.com/health/recipe/0,,10000001949737,00.html)

I'm very hestitant of any white pizza not made by a professional and I have little experience with Smoked Salmon, so when I set out to try this recipe I have to admit that my expectations were low.

What I'll say is this; if you like rich tastes, especially pickled tasting things, this pizza might be right up your ally. Between the capers, the dill/cream cheese spread, and the red onions, *everything* has a bite. It's the type of meal that you'll enjoy if you have just a couple of slices, but beyond that it can be a little bit much. Suffice to say, incredibly happy to have tried it... but I never need to make it again. Try for yourself.

### Ingredients

I chose [this recipe](http://www.simplyscratch.com/2013/11/whole-wheat-pizza-dough-recipe.html) for the pizza dough because I prefer a whole wheat pizza, but any will do I suppose. Even a pre-made, although you're playing with matches if you do that.

Below are the ingredients minus the pizza dough.

What do you do when you have to make a last minute meal decision, have enough fish in the freezer to give you plenty of options, but still want to try something new? I think I've found the one. This recipe has the three qualities we all love: Quick, Easy, Delicious.

1. Sliced smoked salmon

2. Fresh dill (I used it from the tube, but fresh is probably better) ~ 1 tablespoon

3. 1 tablespoon capers

4. 3/4th cup low fat cream cheese

5. 1/2 cup sliced red onion (called for less but I like red onions)

### Steps

1. Prepare your pizza dough if you haven't already done so. If it's had time to refrigerate it will be even better but that's not strictly required.

2. Cook the pizza dough at 450 until crisp. You won't be cooking again.

3. Combine the cream cheese and dill into a paste and then spread on the crust.

4. Top with the smoked salmon, capers, and red onions as desired. Add more dill if wanted.

5. Slice and serve immediately. Enjoy!
