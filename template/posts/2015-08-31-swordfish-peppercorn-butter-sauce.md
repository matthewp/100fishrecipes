There's nothing quite like a good swordfish steak, and getting it right is never easy. So I knew I was taking a chance when I decided to grill it; an overcooked swordfish steak can be very dry. I felt emboldened by this sauce; the lemon and butter would help to keep it moist if I cooked it just a bit too long, and this is what happened here. The edges were well done but everywhere else was moist, having soaked in this delicious sauce. I served it with pan-fried swiss chard and zuchinni, a perfect late-summer dinner.

These ingredients assume 2 steaks.

### Ingredients

1. 2 swordfish steaks (don't go cheap on these)

2. 2 cloves of garlic (1 would be fine if you don't want it to be overpowering, but I like garlic)

3. 1 tablespoon butter, room temperature

4. Peppercorn, ground (to taste)

5. Parsley (to taste)

6. Lemon zest, about 1 teaspoon

### Steps

1. Mix the garlic, melted butter, pepper, lemon zest and parsley in a small bowl. Keep it room temperature.

2. Grill the steaks, about 4 or 5 minutes per side, be careful not to overcook.

3. Garnish the sauce over-top each steak (take lots of pictures to send to jealous friends).

4. Enjoy!
