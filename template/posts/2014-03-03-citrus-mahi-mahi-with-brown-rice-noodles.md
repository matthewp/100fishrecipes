If you're like me you probably have 4 or 5 types of fish in the freezer at all times but most often go to tilapia or salmon because, well, you know how to make it even when you're not in the mood for an elaborate recipe. This recipe will add mahi mahi into that mix. If a simple recipe that you can always remember, with ingredients you probably already have, is your thing, this is the one for you.

Searing is not something I've done a lot of with mahi mahi, but here it works perfectly. With just that little bit of tang from the orange and the complementary noodles, I can see this becoming part of my regular rotation.

### Ingredients

1. Mahi Mahi fillet

2. 2 Mandarin Oranges

3. Brown rice noodles

4. Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning

5. Salt and pepper to taste

6. Olive oil

### Steps

1. 20 minutes prior to cooking place the rice noodles in warm water. Take out before you start cooking.

2. Place the mahi mahi an an ungreased pan.

3. Squeeze one orange over the fish. Sprinkle Mrs. Dash, salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil over top.

4. Cook on both sides covered, about 5 minutes each side, until cooked.

5. Remove fish from the pan and add the noodles in the greasy pan.

6. Squeeze the other orange, add more Mrs. Dash, salt and pepper.

7. After the noodles are fully cooked remove and serve immediately. Enjoy!
