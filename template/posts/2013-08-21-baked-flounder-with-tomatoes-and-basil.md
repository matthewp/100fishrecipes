What do you do when you have to make a last minute meal decision, have enough fish in the freezer to give you plenty of options, but still want to try something new? I think I've found the one. This recipe has the three qualities we all love: Quick, Easy, Delicious.

### Ingredients

1. Flounder

2. Basil leaves (a half a cup or so)

3. Grape tomatoes (you can use any kind of tomatoes, these are just a good size)

4. 3 Garlic cloves

5. 2 tablespoons lemon juice

6. 2 tablespoons olive oil

7. Salt and pepper to taste

### Steps

1. Prepare all of the ingredients. Cut the grape tomatoes in half, mince the garlic, squeeze your lemons (hope you're using fresh lemons).

2. Line a baking pan (a long one) with the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, tomatoes, and basil. 

3. Bake at 425 for 5 minutes.

4. Lay the flounder on top and season with salt and pepper.

5. Cook approximately 10 more minutes.

6. Enjoy!
