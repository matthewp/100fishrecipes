I've had salmon a million different ways and I'm always looking forward to the million and first. This simple dish is just salmon and red pepper. The blend works better than I expected. Highly recommended.

### Ingredients

1. 1/2 cup red peppers (from a jar) but you really can't use too many.

2. 1 teaspoon kosher salt

3. 1 teaspoon olive oil

4. 1 tablespoon tomato paste

5. Half handful of almonds

6. 1 clove of garlic

### Steps

1. Cook your salmon as you like. I usually wrap it in tinfoil and bake for ~30 minutes.

2. Put all of the other ingredients in a food processor or immersion blender and turn into a paste.

3. Serve on the cooked salmon immediately. Enjoy!
