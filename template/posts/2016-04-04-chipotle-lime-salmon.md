After you've made so many recipes that involve a sauce cooked on/with fish you start to think that you've tasted them all. You certainly start to think that you can puree just about anything together and cook it with fish and it will turn out ok, I know I do. But you also rarely come across a recipe that truly surprises you.

Well, this is one of those exceptions. I made mine spicier than I would have preferred but the flavor still managed to shine through. If you are in the mood for a kick, do two chipotle chilis instead of one.

### Ingredients

1. 2 pound salmon filet (or two pieces)

2. 2 tablespoons olive oil

3. 1 lime, juice and zested

4. 1 chipotle chili in adobo (I went with 2 but would have preferred 1)

5. 2 teaspoons adobo sauce (from the same can)

6. 1/2 teaspoon cumin

7. 1 clove garlic

8. Salt and pepper to taste

### Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.

2. Place your salmon filets on a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil and sprayed.

3. Add salt and pepper.

3. Combine olive oil, lime (and zest), chipotle chili, adobo sauce, cumin and garlic in a blender or food processor. Puree.

4. Add the sauce to the top of the salmon, completely covering.

5. Bake for 12 - 15 minutes.

6. Enjoy (but be sure to have water nearby).
