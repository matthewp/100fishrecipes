This is one that I ran across and decided I needed to immediately try it, unmodified. The cucumber yogurt sauce reminds me of something you get with pita-based sandwiches. My only problem with this dish is the lemon didn't serve a purpose, other than to make the other items more kebab-y. Adding a second vegatable, tomatoes maybe, would have given the dish a little more flavor.

### Ingredients

#### Kebabs

1. Salmon fillets, cubed (don't get them skinned)

2. Lemons, sliced

3. 2 zucchini

4. Extra virgin olive oil

5. 1 tablespoon maple syrup.

6. 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

7. 1/4 teaspoon paprika

#### Yogurt sauce

1. 2 garlice cloves

2. A large cucumber, english preferred

3. 3 tablespoons fresh dill

4. 2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves

5. 1 cup greek yogurt

6. Lemon zest

### Steps

1. Prepare all of the ingredients for the kebabs. Cube the salmon, slice the lemon and zucchini.

2. Prepare the kebabs. Alternative the salmon, zucchini and lemon.

3. Mix the oil, lemon juice, maple, salt, and paprika. Brush on the kebabs.

4. In a food processor combine the garlic, salt, pepper, and cucumber, and lemon zest.

5. Add the dill, mint, and yogurt and give it a few more turns.

6. Cook the kebabs just until the salmon is cooked. Do not overcook or the salmon will be rubbery.

7. When serving, but a healthy heap of yogurt sauce on the kebabs.

8. Enjoy!
