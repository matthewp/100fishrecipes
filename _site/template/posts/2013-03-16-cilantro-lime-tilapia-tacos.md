I have another fish taco recipe that is part of my regular rotation. This one is quite a bit different from what I think of as traditional fish tacos. But seeing that fat piece of avacado sitting in the middle made me want to try it. I'm thrilled that I did! Even though this takes a bit more prep than my other recipe, they are simply delicious.

### Ingredients

1. Tilapia fillets (I used 4)

2. 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped or shredded

3. 1 onion, chopped

4. 2 cups tomatoes, diced

5. 3 tablespoons lime juice

6. 4 garlic cloves, finely minced

7. Jalepeños (I used about 1/4 cup)

8. 1 avacado, sliced into wedges

9. Olive oil

10. 5-inch white corn tortillas (or whatever you like)

### Steps

1. Prep all of your ingredients, this takes the longest of all the steps.

2. Heat a large pan with olive oil.

3. Heat another pan to warm your tortillas, about 2 minutes per side.

4. Cook the onion until translucent.

5. Mix in the garlic, just for a minute or so.

6. Cook the tilapia fillets on top, flipping occassionally.

7. With a fork, flake the tilipia into pieces.

8. Mix in the tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, and jalepeños. Allow to cook about 5 more minutes.

9. Serve about a 1/4 cup per tortilla, with an avacado slice on top.

10. Enjoy!
