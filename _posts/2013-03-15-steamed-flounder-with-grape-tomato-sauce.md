I've found that grape tomatoes cooked with a little oil (olive or otherwise) makes a great sauce for just about anything. I first had it in an asparagus recipe I love and when I came across this one I thought it would be perfect. And it was! Aside from the choice to steam, I also left off the basil (as I didn't have any). It turned out delicious nevertheless.

### Ingredients

1. Flounder

2. Grape tomatoes

3. Garlic (2 cloves per piece of fish)

4. Olive oil

5. Salt

6. Pepper

7. Oregano (optional)

### Steps

1. Pour your water into your steamer and turn it on to boil.

2. Smash your garlic, I used a mortar and pestle. 

3. Cut your grape tomatoes into halves.

4. When your pan is hot, pour in about a tablespoon of olive oil and cook the garlic.

5. Cook the grape tomatoes, smash them down just a little, to release the juices.

6. Meanwhile steam your fish, shouldn't take long.

7. After the fish is cooked and the sauce is sufficiently saucy, plate the flounder and pour your sauce over top.

8. Enjoy!
