Inspired by - [Cooking Light](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/herb-crusted-salmon-with-mixed-greens-salad-10000001723390/)

Came up with the idea to make this in kind of the last second and ran to the local Fresh Market to buy the ingredients. Bought the salmon with the skin still on, and not wanting to learn how to properly remove the skin, we elected to leave it on and put the rub on just the one side. For the same reason we decided to bake, rather than cook then in the skillet. The result was satisfying, you can't go wrong with baked salmon no matter how you dress it and this was no exception. I do hope to get back around to trying it the official way some day.

### Ingredients

1. Salmon fillets (with the skin!)

2. 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs (we used Panko)

3. 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano

4. 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary

5. 2 teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

6. 2 garlic cloves, minced

7. 1/4 teaspoon salt

8. 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon rind, grated

9. Lemon juice

### Steps

1. On a plate (or small mixing bowl) mix together the breadcrumbs, oregano, rosemary, parsley, minced garlic, salt, and lemon rind.

2. Pat spice mix into both sides of your fillets (or just the one side if you bought them with the skin, like me).

3. Wrap in aluminum foil (with a little olive oil) and bake for about 30 minutes.

4. When they are ready to serve, squeeze your lemon over the fish.

5. Enjoy!
