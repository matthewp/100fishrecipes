<p>I'm very hestitant of any white pizza not made by a professional and I have little experience with Smoked Salmon, so when I set out to try this recipe I have to admit that my expectations were low.</p>
<p>What I'll say is this; if you like rich tastes, especially pickled tasting things, this pizza might be right up your ally. Between the capers, the dill/cream cheese spread, and the red onions, <em>everything</em> has a bite. It's the type of meal that you'll enjoy if you have just a couple of slices, but beyond that it can be a little bit much. Suffice to say, incredibly happy to have tried it... but I never need to make it again. Try for yourself.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>I chose <a href="http://www.simplyscratch.com/2013/11/whole-wheat-pizza-dough-recipe.html">this recipe</a> for the pizza dough because I prefer a whole wheat pizza, but any will do I suppose. Even a pre-made, although you're playing with matches if you do that.</p>
<p>Below are the ingredients minus the pizza dough.</p>
<p>What do you do when you have to make a last minute meal decision, have enough fish in the freezer to give you plenty of options, but still want to try something new? I think I've found the one. This recipe has the three qualities we all love: Quick, Easy, Delicious.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sliced smoked salmon</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fresh dill (I used it from the tube, but fresh is probably better) ~ 1 tablespoon</p>
</li>
<li><p>1 tablespoon capers</p>
</li>
<li><p>3/4th cup low fat cream cheese</p>
</li>
<li><p>1/2 cup sliced red onion (called for less but I like red onions)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Prepare your pizza dough if you haven't already done so. If it's had time to refrigerate it will be even better but that's not strictly required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cook the pizza dough at 450 until crisp. You won't be cooking again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Combine the cream cheese and dill into a paste and then spread on the crust.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Top with the smoked salmon, capers, and red onions as desired. Add more dill if wanted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slice and serve immediately. Enjoy!</p>
